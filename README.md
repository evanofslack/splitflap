# DIY Split-Flap Display

This is a work in progress DIY [split-flap display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-flap_display). This is a fork of [scottbez1/splitflap](https://github.com/scottbez1/splitflap) where the display housing has been modified to be use 3D printed parts and acrylic panels with the goal of producing a more compact design. By enclosing the stepper motor within the flap housing, the overall footprint of a single unit is reduced. The acrylic panels fully enclose the internal components, leading to a clean and minimal appearance.
